            <p>If you have ever looked at moving truck prices, particularly one way moves, 
            the pricing doesn't always make sense. Why is one moving company almost double 
            the price for the same distance?</p>
            <p>Well, like the airline and hotel industry, moving truck companies have adopted 
            highly sophisticated algorithms and pricing models to squeeze every last penny 
            out of you. We can't change that, but what we can do is help you make a better 
            informed decision on when the best time to rent a truck is, and a comparison of 
            all of the nationwide companies quotes.</p>
            <p>Go ahead, give it a try, you might be amazed at the wide gap between prices or dates.</p>
